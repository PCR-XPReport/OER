----- Explanation of technical terms -----
Edge cases are special or unusual cases in a system that are often on the edge or at the limits of normal functionality. Edge cases are scenarios that are not typical but still need to be considered to ensure that a system is robust and reliable, such as unusual user input or error cases.

Source code clone refers to a situation in which two or more parts of the source code of a software are almost identical or very similar. 

Dead code refers to lines of code that are never executed or whose results are of no further use.
